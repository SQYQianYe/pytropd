 TropD software for calculating tropical width metrics, version 1.0
 Written by Ori Adam, published Jan.22.2018
 Converted to Python by Alison Ming Jul.5.2017
 
 
 The package contains:
 1. 8 Metric functions TropD_Metric_[MetricName] which output various metrics of the edge of the tropics in the SH and NH
 2. 4 Basic calculations: 
    - TropD_Calculate_ZeroCrossing: Find the latitufde of zero crossing of a given field
    - TropD_Calculate_MaxLat: Find the latitude of maximum of a given field 
    - TropD_Calculate_StreamFunction: Calculate the meridional mass streamfunction
    - TropD_Calculate_TropopauseHeight: Calculate the height of the tropopause
    - TropD_Calculate_Mon2Season: Calculate seasonal means from monthly time series 
 3. TropD_Example_Calculations: Example and tutorial code
